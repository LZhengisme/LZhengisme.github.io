# About me
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/), [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/) and [Ben Kao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao). Recently, I received my Bachelor degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm), working with [Qinliang Su](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/3796). My research interests include machine learning, probabilistic graphical models and natural language processing.
