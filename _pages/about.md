# About me
I am currently a final-year undergraduate in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. [Qinliang Su](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/3796). I will be a Ph.D. student in CS department, the University of Hong Kong from Fall 2021 under the supervision of Prof. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/), Prof. [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/) and Prof. [Benjamin C.M. Kao](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~kao/). My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing, in particular latent variable models, structured prediction and their applications on natural language.
