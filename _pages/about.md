# About me
I am currently a final-year undergraduate in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by [Qinliang Su](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/3796). I will be a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) from Fall 2021, under the supervision of [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/), [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/) and [Ben Kao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao). My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing, in particular latent variable models, structured prediction and their applications on natural language.
